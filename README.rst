Aldryn django CMS
=================

|build| |coverage|

An opinionated django CMS setup bundled as an Divio Cloud addon.

This package will auto configure django CMS including some extra tools.
It includes django-filer, a default set of plugins, django-parler,
aldryn-boilerplates and some more. A future goal is to split some of those
other tools into separate addons.

Installation
------------

Nothing to do. ``aldryn-django-cms`` is part of the Divio Cloud platform.

For a manual install:

.. important::
    Please follow the setup instructions for installing
    ``aldryn-addons`` and ``aldryn-django`` first!

The version is made up of the django CMS release with an added digit for the
release version of this package itself.

If you followed the ``aldryn-addons`` and ``aldryn-django`` installation
instructions, you should already have a ``ALDRYN_ADDONS`` setting. Add
``aldryn-django-cms`` to it.::

    INSTALLED_ADDONS = [
        'aldryn-django',
        'aldryn-django-cms',
    ]

Create the ``addons/aldryn-django-cms`` directory at the same level as your
``manage.py``. Then copy ``addon.json``, ``aldryn_config.py`` from
the matching sourcecode into it.
Also create a ``settings.json`` file in the same directory with the following
content::

    {
      "cms_templates": "[[\"default.html\", \"Default\"]]"
    }

.. important::

    The above ``settings.json`` assume you have a ``default.html``
    cms template installed.

.. note::

    The need to manually copy ``aldryn_config.py`` and ``addon.json`` is
    due to legacy compatibility with the Aldryn Platform and will no
    longer be necessary in a later release of aldryn-addons.


Running Tests
-------------

You can run tests by executing::

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
    python setup.py test
